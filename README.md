# Scraping_Senscritique_users_data
The website senscritique.com gathers several hundreds of thousands of users' reviews on different media (movies, music, books etc). Our goal was to create a model that matches people's tastes in terms of music with their tastes in terms of movies. 
In order to do that, we needed to obtain a dataset that would give, for a given user, their preferences in both domains.
