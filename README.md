# Scraping_Senscritique_users_data
The website senscritique.com gathers several hundreds of thousands of users' reviews on different media (movies, music, books etc). 

The following notebook implements a scraper that allows one to build a database of all users' ratings for movies and songs. The code is easy to modify and can be adapted to your specific needs (adding book reviews, comments of the author...).
